CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + pyruvate + phosphate = AMP + CC       phosphoenolpyruvate + diphosphate. CC   -!- COFACTOR: CC       Name=Mg(2+); Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:18420; CC   -!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by light-induced dephosphorylation. CC       Inhibited by dark-induced phosphorylation. Both reactions are CC       catalyzed by PDRP1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610096}. CC   -!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain contains the ATP/Pi binding site, CC       the central domain the pyrophosphate/phosphate carrier histidine, CC       and the C-terminal domain the pyruvate binding site. CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylation of Thr-453 in the dark inactivates the CC       enzyme. Dephosphorylation upon light stimulation reactivates the CC       enzyme (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction takes place in three steps, each CC       mediated by a carrier histidine residue located on the surface of CC       the central domain. The two first partial reactions are catalyzed CC       at an active site located on the N-terminal domain, and the third CC       partial reaction is catalyzed at an active site located on the C- CC       terminal domain. For catalytic turnover, the central domain CC       swivels from the concave surface of the N-terminal domain to that CC       of the C-terminal domain. CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEP-utilizing enzyme family. CC       {ECO:0000305}.

Gi: Q9ZAD8  Possivel função:   General (non sugar-specific) component of the CC       phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system CC       (sugar PTS). This major carbohydrate active-transport system CC       catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar substrates CC       concomitantly with their translocation across the cell membrane. CC       Enzyme I transfers the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate CC       (PEP) to the phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr). CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + protein L-histidine = CC       pyruvate + protein N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine. CC   -!- COFACTOR: CC       Name=Mg(2+); Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:18420; Evidence={ECO:0000250}; CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. CC   -!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain contains the HPr binding site, the CC       central domain the pyrophosphate/phosphate carrier histidine, and CC       the C-terminal domain the pyruvate binding site. {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction takes place in three steps, mediated CC       by a phosphocarrier histidine residue located on the surface of CC       the central domain. The two first partial reactions are catalyzed CC       at an active site located on the N-terminal domain, and the third CC       partial reaction is catalyzed at an active site located on the C- CC       terminal domain. For catalytic turnover, the central domain CC       swivels from the concave surface of the N-terminal domain to that CC       of the C-terminal domain (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEP-utilizing enzyme family. CC       {ECO:0000305}.
