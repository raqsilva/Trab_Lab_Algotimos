CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) = CC       diphosphate + DNA(n+1). CC   -!- SUBUNIT: The DNA polymerase holoenzyme is a complex that contains CC       10 different types of subunits. These subunits are organized into CC       3 functionally essential subassemblies: the pol III core, the beta CC       sliding clamp processivity factor and the clamp-loading complex. CC       The pol III core (subunits alpha,epsilon and theta) contains the CC       polymerase and the 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activities. The CC       polymerase is tethered to the template via the sliding clamp CC       processivity factor. The clamp-loading complex assembles the beta CC       processivity factor onto the primer template and plays a central CC       role in the organization and communication at the replication CC       fork. This complex contains delta, delta', psi and chi, and copies CC       of either or both of two different DnaX proteins, gamma and tau. CC       The composition of the holoenzyme is, therefore: CC       (alpha,epsilon,theta)[2]-(gamma/tau)[3]-delta,delta', psi,chi- CC       beta[4]. The beta chain is a homodimer when not associated with CC       the other components (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}.

PolIII' associates CC       with the gamma complex (composed of gamma, delta, delta', psi and CC       chi chains) and with the beta chain to form the complete DNA CC       polymerase III complex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
