Gi: P36088  Possivel função:   Catalyzes the reversible oxidation-reduction of the R- CC       enantiomer of free methionine sulfoxide to methionine. Does not CC       act on S-enantiomer of free methionine sulfoxide or R-enantiomer CC       of dabsylated methionine sulfoxide. Involved in protection against CC       oxidative stress. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19049972}. CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H(2)O = CC       L-methionine (R)-S-oxide + thioredoxin. CC       {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19049972}.

CC       Nucleus {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14562095}. CC   -!- DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE: Single deletion of fRMsr has complete growth CC       inhibition on methionine-R-sulfoxide medium and fRMsr and MXR1 CC       double deletion completely blocks the growth on both methionine-R- CC       sulfoxide and methionine-S-sulfoxide medium. FRMsr and MXR2 double CC       deletion has no effect on growth on methionine-S-sulfoxide medium. CC       Single mutant or any of the double mutants show no growth defects CC       in methionine medium, even the fRMsr, MXR1 and MXR2 triple CC       deletion mutant is viable and grows similarly to wild-type. Single CC       deletion of fRMsr has an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress CC       and a decreased life span of 18% compared to wild-type. FRMsr and CC       MXR1, as well as fRMsr and MXR2 double mutants, and fRMsr, MXR1 CC       and MXR2 triple mutant show 20% reduction in life span compared CC       with wild-type cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19049972}. CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2610 molecules/cell in log phase SD CC       medium. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14562106}. CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the free Met sulfoxide reductase family.
