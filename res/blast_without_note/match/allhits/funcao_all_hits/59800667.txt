Gi: P0A9M8  Possivel função:   Involved in acetate metabolism. Catalyzes the reversible CC       interconversion of acetyl-CoA and acetyl phosphate. The direction CC       of the overall reaction changes depending on growth conditions. On CC       minimal medium acetyl-CoA is generated. In rich medium acetyl-CoA CC       is converted to acetate and allowing the cell to dump the excess CC       of acetylation potential in exchange for energy in the form of CC       ATP. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15687190}. CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + phosphate = CoA + acetyl CC       phosphate. CC   -!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by NADH and ATP.
