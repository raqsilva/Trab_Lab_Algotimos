Gi: O66505  Possivel função:   Subunit of the protein translocation channel SecYEG. CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Component of the Sec protein translocase complex. CC       Heterotrimer consisting of SecY, SecE and SecG subunits. The CC       heterotrimers can form oligomers, although 1 heterotrimer is CC       thought to be able to translocate proteins. Interacts with SecDF, CC       and other proteins may be involved. The channel interacts with CC       SecA via subunit SecY. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18923516}.

Gi: P0AG99  Possivel função:   Subunit of the protein translocation channel SecYEG. CC       Overexpression of some hybrid proteins has been thought to jam the CC       protein secretion apparatus resulting in cell death; while this CC       may be true it also results in FtsH-mediated degradation of SecY. CC       Treatment with antibiotics that block translation elongation such CC       as chloramphenicol also leads to degradation of SecY and SecE but CC       not SecG. CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Component of the Sec protein translocase complex. CC       Heterotrimer consisting of SecY, SecE and SecG subunits. The CC       heterotrimers can form oligomers, although 1 heterotrimer is CC       thought to be able to translocate proteins. SecG probably contacts CC       ribosomal protein L23 and/or L29 when the translocation complex is CC       docked with the ribosome.

Gi: Q2G026  Possivel função:   Subunit of the protein translocation channel SecYEG (By CC       similarity). While not essential, it considerably increases the CC       export efficiency of extracellular proteins. {ECO:0000250, CC       ECO:0000269|PubMed:20472795}. CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Component of the Sec protein translocase complex. CC       Heterotrimer consisting of SecY, SecE and SecG subunits.

The channel interacts with CC       SecA via subunit SecY (By similarity). Also part of the accessory CC       SecA2/SecY2 protein translocation apparatus required to export CC       cell wall protein GspB. {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane {ECO:0000250}; Multi-pass CC       membrane protein {ECO:0000250}. CC   -!- DISRUPTION PHENOTYPE: Grows normally, a double secG/secY2 mutant CC       enters stationary phase earlier. Significant differences in the CC       export pattern of a number of extracellular proteins are seen in a CC       secG deletion; the double secG/secY2 mutant exacerbates this CC       effect (shown in RN4220). Single or double deletions are as CC       virulent as wild-type (shown in RN4220 and SH1000). CC       {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20472795}. CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SecG family. {ECO:0000305}.
